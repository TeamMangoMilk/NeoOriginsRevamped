# NeoOrigins

A modern, ground-up reimplementation of the Origins experience for **NeoForge**.

Supports **MC 26.1** (Java 25) and **MC 1.21.1** (Java 21).

📖 **Pack-author docs**: [cyberday1.github.io/NeoOrigins](https://cyberday1.github.io/NeoOrigins/) — full reference for all 84 power types, 75 conditions, 45 actions, and 33 events.

---

## What's new in 2.0

NeoOrigins 2.0 collapses 88 bespoke Java power-type classes into ~25 generic types driven by a JSON action / condition / event DSL. Pack authors now get a stable, schema-validated authoring surface; existing Origins-mod packs keep loading verbatim via transparent legacy aliases.

Highlights this release:

- **Aquatic overhaul** — Abyssal / Merling / Kraken / Siren rebuilt around a real dry-out mechanic with master configs for drain rate and drown damage. New "Pescivore + Raw Adapted" diet (raw cod and salmon nourish like cooked). Spawn placement now prefers ocean floor / water surface for aquatic origins.
- **Mod compat** — `LightTexture` and water-vision mixins now apply at higher priority so they survive other mods (Alex's Caves, etc.) that touch the same vanilla pipelines.
- **Dedicated-server stable** on both 1.21.1 and 26.1 (singleplayer-tested through alpha.27 hid six classes of dist crash; all fixed).
- **New `throw_target` action** — raycast the entity under your crosshair and hurl them away + upward.
- **80 power types, 75 conditions, 45 actions, 33 events** — `near_entity` condition, 6 new visual/interaction power types (burn, ignore_water, overlay, model_color, lava_vision, shader), and near-complete Origins compat coverage are new in 2.0.11.

## Features

- **46 built-in origins** across two layers — choose an origin *and* a class
- **20 built-in classes** — Warrior, Archer, Miner, Beastmaster, Explorer, Sentinel, Herbalist, Scout, Berserker, Titan, Rogue, Lumberjack, Blacksmith, Cook, Merchant, Cleric, Nitwit, **Fisher**, **Mason**, **Paladin**
- **130+ power types** — attribute modifiers (with optional environment, condition, or equipment-slot gating), status/persistent effects, creative flight + natural elytra glide (no-item), wall climbing, bare-hand-as-tool (any vanilla tool at any tier), damage modification, on-hit/on-kill actions, active abilities (with hunger gating), biome effects, summon minions, tame hostile mobs, Fortune-from-effect loot multipliers, gravity wells, elemental magic, toggleable passives, HUD-hide powers, and more
- **Random origin mode** — server config to randomly assign origins on first join or every death
- **Cooldown HUD overlay** — shows active ability cooldown bars above the hotbar
- **Origin info screen** — press O to view your current origin and class details. Shows the origin's evolution path (tier names + add/remove powers) when the origin declares `tier_powers`
- **Named-keybind pool** — packs can declare more than six active abilities; each `"key"` translation id on a power gets a labelled hotkey slot the player can rebind from *Controls → Key Binds → NeoOrigins (Hotkeys)*. See [docs/API.md#named-keybinds](docs/API.md#named-keybinds)
- **Skinnable UI** — origin selection / info screens read colours, panel texture, font and 9-slice insets from a datapack-and-resourcepack theme. Ships with `neoorigins:parchment` (bundled Newsreader OFL font); addon packs can register their own theme and activate it via `data/<ns>/neoorigins/active_theme.json`. See [docs/THEMING.md](docs/THEMING.md) and the copy-and-edit skeleton at [`docs/theme-template/`](docs/theme-template)
- **JEI / REI integration** — info panel for Orb of Origin
- **Hot-reload** — `/reload` rebuilds all origins and powers without restarting the server
- **Origins pack compatibility** — drop existing Origins mod content packs into `originpacks/` and they load automatically
- **Data-driven** — all origins and powers defined in JSON; fully overridable via datapacks
- **Advancement-based origin upgrades** — any origin can declare upgrade paths in its JSON; when the player earns the advancement, their origin swaps automatically (see [examples/](examples/))
- **Epic Fight compatibility** — sized origins maintain correct scale when Epic Fight takes over rendering in combat mode
- **Per-origin config toggles** — disable any built-in origin or class in `neoorigins-common.toml`
- **Dimension restrictions** — disable specific powers in specific dimensions via config

---

## Mob Origin System (2.1)

Pack authors can author origins **for mobs** the same way they author origins for
players. A mob origin is a JSON file under `data/<ns>/origins/mob_origins/<id>.json`
that bundles powers, weighted spawn rules, drops, and behavior — applied to any
non-player `LivingEntity`.

- **Weighted spawn rules** — apply origins to natural mob spawns with biome,
  structure, dimension, time-of-day, Y-range and light-range filters
- **Per-origin drops** — additive or replace, with both per-item independent-chance
  and weighted-pool strategies, layered onto vanilla loot via a global loot modifier
- **`neoorigins:mob_behavior` power** — configurable, piglin-style aggression
  (neutral / hostile / conditional) using the existing entity-condition DSL
- **Spawn-egg minting** — `/neoorigins mob egg <origin>` produces a vanilla spawn
  egg that spawns the mob with the origin pre-attached; right-clicking it on a
  spawner reconfigures the spawner too
- **Mob Origin Creator GUI** — tabbed in-game authoring tool (Identity / Powers /
  Spawn Rules / Drops / JSON Preview). Open with `/neoorigins mob editor` _(Phase 6,
  pending)_ or bind the *Open Mob Origin Creator* keybind in Controls → Key Binds →
  NeoOrigins
- **Portable output** — written to `<world>/datapacks/neoorigins_custom/`; copy the
  folder to another instance with NeoOrigins installed and it keeps working

See [`docs/MOB_ORIGINS.md`](docs/MOB_ORIGINS.md) for the pack-author reference.

---

## Global Power Sets

Grant powers to entities **without an origin assignment** — NeoOrigins' port of
Apoli's `apoli:global` feature. A global power set is a JSON file under
`data/<ns>/global_powers/<id>.json` that lists `powers` and an optional
`entity_types` filter (mixing literal ids and `#tags`); when the filter is absent
the powers apply to every player and mob.

- **Players** — granted on login and re-reconciled on `/reload`; persisted like
  any other dynamically-granted power
- **Mobs** — mob-applicable powers applied at spawn (`FinalizeSpawnEvent`)
- **`order`** — optional load/apply ordering (lower applies first)

See [`docs/GLOBAL_POWERS.md`](docs/GLOBAL_POWERS.md) for the pack-author reference.

## Built-in Classes

Classes are a second selection layer — every player picks both an origin and a class. All class powers are passive or condition-gated — **zero keybind slots consumed** by any class.

Pack authors can add their own classes — see [docs/CLASSES.md](docs/CLASSES.md).

```

---

## Installation

1. Install [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) for your Minecraft version (26.1 or 1.21.1)
2. Drop `neoorigins-<version>.jar` into your `mods/` folder
3. Launch — the `originpacks/` folder is created automatically in your game directory

---

## Origins Pack Compatibility (`originpacks/`)

NeoOrigins can load content from existing Origins mod packs without any modification. On first launch, an `originpacks/` folder is created in your game directory (next to `mods/` and `config/`).

**Supported pack formats:**
| Format | How to install |
|--------|---------------|
| `.jar` (Origins mod JAR) | Drop directly into `originpacks/` |
| `.zip` (datapack) | Drop directly into `originpacks/` |
| Folder | Drop the unpacked folder into `originpacks/` |

Packs are scanned at world load and on `/reload`. No `pack.mcmeta` is required.

### What translates automatically

NeoOrigins runs two translation passes over Origins-format JSON at load time.

**Route A — direct type mapping** (static translation to a NeoOrigins equivalent):

| Origins type | Result |
|---|---|
| `origins:attribute` | `neoorigins:attribute_modifier` |
| `origins:elytra_flight` / `origins:creative_flight` | `neoorigins:flight` |
| `origins:night_vision` | `neoorigins:night_vision` |
| `origins:water_breathing` | `neoorigins:water_breathing` |
| `origins:stacking_status_effect` / `origins:status_effect` | `neoorigins:status_effect` |
| `origins:effect_immunity` | `neoorigins:effect_immunity` |
| `origins:modify_damage_taken` / `origins:modify_damage_dealt` | `neoorigins:modify_damage` |
| `origins:invulnerability` | `neoorigins:prevent_action` (fire, approximate) |
| `origins:prevent_death` / `apace:prevent_death` | `neoorigins:prevent_death` (condition + `entity_action` honored; `damage_condition` packs fall back to Route B) |
| `origins:disable_regen` | `neoorigins:prevent_action` (sprint food) |
| `origins:slow_falling` | `neoorigins:prevent_action` (fall damage) |
| `origins:walk_speed` | `neoorigins:attribute_modifier` (movement speed) |
| `origins:modify_swim_speed` / `origins:swim_speed` | `neoorigins:attribute_modifier` (water movement efficiency) |
| `origins:climbing` | `neoorigins:wall_climbing` |
| `origins:keep_inventory` | `neoorigins:keep_inventory` |
| `origins:ignore_water` | `neoorigins:ignore_water` |
| `origins:phasing` | `neoorigins:wraith_phase` |
| `origins:burn` | `neoorigins:burn` |
| `origins:particle` | `neoorigins:particle` |
| `origins:overlay` | `neoorigins:overlay` |
| `origins:model_color` | `neoorigins:model_color` |
| `origins:lava_vision` | `neoorigins:lava_vision` |
| `origins:shader` | `neoorigins:shader` |
| `origins:food_restriction` / `origins:edible_item` | `neoorigins:food_restriction` / `neoorigins:edible_item` |
| `origins:multiple` | Expanded to individual sub-powers |

**Route B — compat power engine** (compiled into live event-driven behaviour at load time):

| Origins type | What it does |
|---|---|
| `origins:active_self` | Full active ability with cooldown |
| `origins:toggle` | Toggled active power with optional cooldown |
| `origins:resource` | Integer resource bar with min/max |
| `origins:conditioned_attribute` | Attribute modifier gated on a condition |
| `origins:conditioned_status_effect` | Status effect gated on a condition |
| `origins:action_on_being_hit` | Triggers an action when the player takes damage |
| `origins:action_on_hit` | Triggers an action when the player deals damage |

### What is skipped

The following types have no equivalent in NeoOrigins and are **silently skipped** — the rest of the origin still loads:

- `origins:shaking` — visual effect (no equivalent)

A full compat log is written to `logs/neoorigins-compat.log` every time origins load so you can see exactly what translated and what did not.

---

## Writing Your Own Origins

Place JSON files in your datapack under:

```
data/<namespace>/origins/origins/<name>.json   # origin definitions
data/<namespace>/origins/powers/<name>.json    # power definitions
data/<namespace>/origins/origin_layers/<name>.json  # layer definitions
```

NeoOrigins format example:

```json
{
  "name": { "text": "Merling" },
  "description": { "text": "Adapted to life underwater." },
  "icon": "minecraft:prismarine_shard",
  "impact": "medium",
  "powers": ["neoorigins:merling_water_breathing", "neoorigins:merling_aquatic_speed"]
}
```

For Origins-mod-compatible path layout (`data/<ns>/origins/`, `data/<ns>/powers/`, `data/<ns>/origin_layers/`) the translation pass runs automatically.

---

## Origin Spawn Locations

Any origin can declare a `spawn_location` that the mod will teleport the player to:

1. **Immediately when they pick the origin** (via the selection screen or an Orb of Origin), and
2. **On death when they have no bed or respawn anchor set** — instead of world spawn.

```json
{
  "name": "origins.mypack.void_knight.name",
  "description": "origins.mypack.void_knight.description",
  "icon": "minecraft:end_crystal",
  "powers": [ "mypack:void_knight_flight" ],
  "spawn_location": {
    "dimension": "minecraft:the_end",
    "structure": "minecraft:end_city"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dimension` | Identifier | Target dimension (player is switched to this level) |
| `biome` | Identifier | Find a position inside this biome ID |
| `biome_tag` | Identifier | Find a position inside a biome with this tag |
| `structure` | Identifier | Find a position inside this structure |
| `structure_tag` | Identifier | Find a position inside a structure with this tag |
| `allow_water_surface` | boolean | Default `false`. If no dry land column is found, accept the topmost water column — player spawns feet-in-water, head above. |
| `allow_ocean_floor` | boolean | Default `false`. If no dry land column is found, accept the seabed — player spawns submerged on the floor (needs water breathing to survive). |

All fields are optional; fields combine with AND (dimension narrows the search, then structure/biome pins down the position within that dimension). Structure match takes precedence over biome when both are specified. The finder sweeps a 5×5 column area around the hit and scans top-down for the first `(solid, air, air)` column — logical height is respected, so Nether spawns stay below the bedrock ceiling. When that strict land pass finds nothing, `allow_ocean_floor` tries `(solid, water, water)`, then `allow_water_surface` tries the water surface. Search radius is 6400 blocks from that dimension's world spawn; if nothing matches at all, the origin selection/respawn proceeds without teleport (with a warning in the log).

On a respawn **with** a set bed or respawn anchor, vanilla behavior applies — `spawn_location` is only used when there's no respawn point to honor.

The same dimension/biome/structure fields can gate a `neoorigins:attribute_modifier` power effect as a `location_condition` — see [docs/POWER_TYPES.md](docs/POWER_TYPES.md#neooriginsattribute_modifier). (`allow_water_surface` / `allow_ocean_floor` are ignored in the gate path — they only influence the spawn finder.)

---

## Advancement-Based Origin Upgrades

Any origin can declare upgrade paths that fire when the player earns specific advancements. This is fully datapack-driven — no Java code required.

Add an `upgrades` list to any origin JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "...",
  "powers": ["..."],
  "upgrades": [
    {
      "advancement": "minecraft:story/enter_the_nether",
      "origin": "neoorigins:strider",
      "announcement": "mypack.upgrade.strider"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Per-layer**: the same advancement can drive different swaps on different layers (origin + class)
- **Chainable**: each intermediate origin defines its own `upgrades` to the next stage
- **announcement** is optional — a translation key sent as a system message on upgrade

See the [examples/](examples/) folder for working datapacks demonstrating simple upgrades, multi-stage chains, and class-layer promotions.
