/**
 * Server-side index of pack-declared named keybinds.
 *
 * <p>Apoli-style active powers can declare {@code "key": "translation.key.id"}
 * to bind themselves to a named hotkey instead of one of the 6 hardcoded skill
 * slots. The compat loader writes those bindings into this registry at reload;
 * the client receives a sorted snapshot via
 * {@link com.cyberday1.neoorigins.network.payload.SyncKeybindRegistryPayload}
 * and assigns each declared key to an anonymous KeyMapping slot from the pool
 * sized by {@code NeoOriginsClientConfig.HOTKEY_POOL_SIZE}.
 *
 * <p>When the player presses an assigned slot, the client sends
 * {@link com.cyberday1.neoorigins.network.payload.ActivatePowerByKeyPayload}
 * with the original translation id; the server resolves it via
 * {@link #dispatch(ServerPlayer, String, boolean)} against the player's
 * currently-granted powers.
 *
 * <p>Edge vs. continuous semantics are stored per binding — the client always
 * polls the key as "currently held" and the server applies the right cadence
 * (edge detection for non-continuous, every-tick fire for continuous).
