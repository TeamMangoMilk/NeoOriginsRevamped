# NeoOrigins Power Types Reference

All powers share three optional metadata fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | string or `{"text":"..."}` / `{"translate":"..."}` | Display name shown in the origin selection screen. A plain string is treated as a translation key. |
| `description` | string or `{"text":"..."}` / `{"translate":"..."}` | Description shown below the power name. Same resolution rules as `name`. |
| `hidden` | bool (default `false`) | When `true`, this power is excluded from the origin info panel. The mechanical effect still applies — only the display row is suppressed. Useful for purely-internal flag/glue powers (e.g. `neoorigins:toggle`, on-hit setters wired under a `multiple`). |

If neither `name` nor `description` is present, NeoOrigins falls back to the lang key convention:
`power.<namespace>.<path>.name` / `power.<namespace>.<path>.description`

---

## `neoorigins:attribute_modifier`

Adds or multiplies a player attribute while the origin is active. Optionally gated on an environment condition, an equipped-item condition, or both (AND).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `attribute` | Identifier | yes | — | Attribute to modify, e.g. `minecraft:generic.movement_speed` |
| `amount` | double | yes | — | Amount to add or multiply |
| `operation` | string | no | `add_value` | `add_value`, `add_multiplied_base`, or `add_multiplied_total` |
| `condition` | string | no | — | Environment gate: `in_water`, `on_land`, or `in_lava`. Tick-driven apply/remove. |
| `equipment_condition` | object | no | — | Equipment gate (see below). Tick-driven apply/remove. |
| `location_condition` | object | no | — | Location gate — dimension / biome / structure (see below). Tick-driven apply/remove. |

**Operations:**
- `add_value` — flat addition to base value
- `add_multiplied_base` — adds `base * amount` (e.g. `-0.1` = 10% slower)
- `add_multiplied_total` — multiplies total after all other modifiers

**`equipment_condition` object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slot` | string | yes | One of `mainhand`, `offhand`, `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `body` |
| `item` | Identifier | no | Exact item ID to match (e.g. `minecraft:iron_helmet`) |
| `tag` | Identifier | no | Item tag to match (e.g. `minecraft:helmets`) |

If both `item` and `tag` are given, either match satisfies the condition (OR). If neither is given, any non-empty stack in the slot counts as a match. When multiple of `condition` / `equipment_condition` / `location_condition` are set, **all** must hold for the modifier to apply.

**`location_condition` object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dimension` | Identifier | no | Match only in this dimension, e.g. `minecraft:the_end` |
| `biome` | Identifier | no | Match only in this specific biome, e.g. `minecraft:plains` |
| `biome_tag` | Identifier | no | Match only in biomes with this tag, e.g. `minecraft:is_forest` |
| `structure` | Identifier | no | Match only inside this structure, e.g. `minecraft:end_city` |
| `structure_tag` | Identifier | no | Match only inside structures with this tag, e.g. `minecraft:on_ocean_monument_maps` |

All fields are optional and combine with AND. So `{ "dimension": "minecraft:the_end", "structure": "minecraft:end_city" }` is "only when standing inside an End City in The End." Structure membership is evaluated server-side via `ServerLevel.structureManager()`.

**Example — 8 flat armor (unconditional):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:attribute_modifier",
  "attribute": "minecraft:generic.armor",
  "amount": 8.0,
  "operation": "add_value",
  "name": "Shell",
  "description": "Has permanent natural armor."
}
```

**Example — slower on land only:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:attribute_modifier",
  "attribute": "minecraft:generic.movement_speed",
  "amount": -0.25,
  "operation": "add_multiplied_base",
  "condition": "on_land",
  "name": "Landwalker",
  "description": "Moves slower while out of water."
}
```

**Example — +1 attack when wearing any helmet:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:attribute_modifier",
  "attribute": "minecraft:generic.attack_damage",
  "amount": 1.0,
  "equipment_condition": {
    "slot": "head",
    "tag": "minecraft:helmets"
  },
  "name": "Helm of Valor",
  "description": "Empowered while helmeted."
}
```

**Example — +2 armor only inside End Cities:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:attribute_modifier",
  "attribute": "minecraft:generic.armor",
  "amount": 2.0,
  "location_condition": {
    "dimension": "minecraft:the_end",
    "structure": "minecraft:end_city"
  },
  "name": "Void Ward",
  "description": "Armored while within the towers of the End."
}
```

**Useful attributes:**
- `minecraft:movement_speed` — walk speed (base ≈ 0.1)
- `minecraft:water_movement_efficiency` — swim speed boost (0.0–1.0, stacks with Depth Strider)
- `minecraft:armor` — armor points
- `minecraft:armor_toughness` — armor toughness
- `minecraft:attack_damage` — melee damage
- `minecraft:attack_speed` — attack cooldown speed
- `minecraft:max_health` — max HP
- `minecraft:fall_damage_multiplier` — fall damage scale
- `minecraft:mining_efficiency` — mining speed bonus
- `minecraft:oxygen_bonus` — extends underwater air (like Respiration)

> **Note:** 1.21+ uses short-form IDs (`minecraft:movement_speed`). The legacy `minecraft:generic.movement_speed` format still parses via fallback.

---

## `neoorigins:status_effect`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:persistent_effect`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Continuously applies a potion effect while the origin is active. The effect is refreshed every tick and removed when the origin is revoked.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `effect` | Identifier | yes | — | Effect ID, e.g. `minecraft:strength` |
| `amplifier` | int | no | `0` | Effect level (0 = level I, 1 = level II, …) |
| `ambient` | bool | no | `true` | Whether the effect is ambient (reduced particle visibility) |
| `show_particles` | bool | no | `false` | Whether to show particles |

**Example — permanent Strength I:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:status_effect",
  "effect": "minecraft:strength",
  "amplifier": 0,
  "name": "Brute Strength",
  "description": "Permanently empowered by inner fire."
}
```

**Common effects:** `minecraft:strength`, `minecraft:speed`, `minecraft:haste`, `minecraft:regeneration`, `minecraft:resistance`, `minecraft:fire_resistance`, `minecraft:water_breathing`, `minecraft:night_vision`, `minecraft:jump_boost`, `minecraft:slow_falling`

---

## `neoorigins:prevent_action`

Prevents a specific harmful action or event from affecting the player.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | string | yes | — | The action to prevent (see values below) |
| `head` / `chest` / `legs` / `feet` | bool | no | `false` | Per-slot toggles for `armor_equip` only. When `true`, the matching armor slot rejects equip attempts (item snaps back to inventory, drops on the ground if full). |

**Action values:**

| Value | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| `fire` | All fire and lava damage |
| `fall_damage` | All fall damage |
| `drown` | Drowning damage |
| `freeze` | Freeze damage from powder snow |
| `sprint_food` | Sprinting no longer drains extra hunger |
| `armor_equip` | Prevents wearing armor in any slot whose corresponding `head` / `chest` / `legs` / `feet` boolean is `true`. Items are ejected back to the inventory (or dropped if full). |
| `chestplate_equip` | Legacy alias of `armor_equip` with `chest: true`. Kept for back-compat with packs that pre-date `armor_equip`. |
| `eye_damage` | Prevents projectile hits to the eye |
| `water_damage` | Prevents water/rain contact damage |
| `swim` | Prevents swimming (velocity-sinks the player in water) |
| `sleep` | Prevents sleeping (bed use returns a "no sleep" message). Sleepless origins should pair this with `modify_player_spawn` if they still want bed interactions to set respawn. |
| `elytra` | Prevents elytra flight (player is stopped from gliding each tick) |

**Example — fire immunity:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:prevent_action",
  "action": "fire",
  "name": "Fire Immunity",
  "description": "Immune to fire and lava."
}
```

**Example — heavy-armor restriction (chest + legs only):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:prevent_action",
  "action": "armor_equip",
  "chest": true,
  "legs":  true,
  "name": "Light-Footed",
  "description": "Cannot wear chestplate or leggings."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:modify_lava_speed`

Modifies the player's movement speed while submerged in lava. Uses the `NumericModifierRegistry` system consumed by `LivingEntityLavaSpeedMixin`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `operation` | string | no | `"addition"` | `"addition"` or `"multiply"` |
| `value` | double | yes | — | Amount to add or multiply. Vanilla lava-swim factor is `0.02`; an addition of `0.4` gives roughly walking speed. |

**Example — strider-like lava swimming:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_lava_speed",
  "operation": "addition",
  "value": 0.4,
  "name": "Molten Stride",
  "description": "Swims through lava at normal walking speed."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:modify_damage`

Multiplies damage dealt or received, optionally filtered to a specific damage type and, for `direction: out`, restricted to a target entity group.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `direction` | string | no | `in` | `in` (damage received) or `out` (damage dealt) |
| `multiplier` | float | no | `1.0` | Damage multiplier (e.g. `2.0` = double, `0.5` = half) |
| `damage_type` | string | no | _(all types)_ | Optional vanilla damage type to filter, e.g. `drown`, `fire`, `fall` |
| `target_group` | string | no | _(any)_ | Outgoing only. Restrict to targets in this entity group: `undead`, `arthropod`, `illager`, `aquatic`. Resolved as the vanilla `minecraft:<group>` entity-type tag. |

**Example — double incoming water damage:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_damage",
  "direction": "in",
  "multiplier": 2.5,
  "damage_type": "drown",
  "name": "Water Weakness",
  "description": "Takes extra damage from water."
}
```

**Example — bonus fire damage dealt:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_damage",
  "direction": "out",
  "multiplier": 1.5,
  "damage_type": "fire",
  "name": "Fire Mastery",
  "description": "Deals extra fire damage."
}
```

**Example — +50% damage to undead:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_damage",
  "direction": "out",
  "multiplier": 1.5,
  "target_group": "undead",
  "name": "Smite",
  "description": "Strikes the undead harder."
}
```

**Common damage types:** `fire`, `in_fire`, `lava`, `drown`, `fall`, `freeze`, `magic`, `wither`, `lightning_bolt`, `fly_into_wall`, `generic`

**Matching:** damage types are matched against both the vanilla message ID (camelCase, e.g. `flyIntoWall`) and the registry key path (snake_case, e.g. `fly_into_wall`). Either convention works. Tag-based filters like `#minecraft:is_fire` match all damage types in that tag.

---

## `neoorigins:prevent_death`

Cancels the lethal blow instead of letting the player die. Faithful to Origins' `prevent_death`, with first-class condition and damage-type gating.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `condition` | object | no | _(always)_ | Standard entity condition; the power only saves the player while it is true. |
| `damage_types` | string | no | _(all)_ | Damage-type filter (comma-separated, `#tags`, msgIds, or registry keys). When set, only matching killing blows are prevented. |
| `invert` | bool | no | `false` | Flips `damage_types` into a blacklist: prevent all deaths _except_ the listed types. |
| `set_health` | float | no | `1.0` | Health the player is left at after a save (minimum 1). |
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `0` | After a save, the power is inert for N ticks. `0` = unlimited (Origins behavior). |
| `entity_action` | object | no | — | Optional action run on the player each time a death is prevented. |

**Example — survive lethal fire once every 30 s, then drop to 4 hearts:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:prevent_death",
  "damage_types": "#minecraft:is_fire,lava",
  "set_health": 8.0,
  "cooldown_ticks": 600,
  "name": "Fireproof Soul",
  "description": "Cannot burn to death — but only so often."
}
```

**Example — immortal except to the void, only while sneaking:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:prevent_death",
  "damage_types": "fell_out_of_world",
  "invert": true,
  "condition": { "type": "origins:sneaking" },
  "name": "Guarded Stance",
  "description": "Death cannot touch a braced body — the void still can."
}
```

**Caveat (same as Origins):** this only cancels the lethal event; it does not clear the damage source. For recurring damage-over-time (fire, lava, poison) pair it with a `condition` or an `entity_action` that removes the source, otherwise the player is re-killed on the next damage tick.

---

## `neoorigins:flight`

Grants the player creative-style free flight. The player can fly freely at any time without an elytra.

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:flight",
  "name": "Natural Flight",
  "description": "Can fly freely without an elytra."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:night_vision`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:persistent_effect`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Grants permanent Night Vision at full strength (no ambient effect, no particles). The effect is refreshed every tick.

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:night_vision",
  "name": "Dark Vision",
  "description": "Can see clearly in total darkness."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:water_breathing`

Grants permanent Water Breathing. The player never loses air while underwater.

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:water_breathing",
  "name": "Gills",
  "description": "Can breathe underwater indefinitely."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:no_slowdown`

Prevents the player from being slowed by movement-impeding blocks: cobwebs,
sweet berry bushes, and powder snow (the stuck-velocity clamp), plus soul
sand and honey blocks (the reduced walk-speed factor).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `block_tag` | string | no | _(all slowdown blocks)_ | Restrict immunity to blocks in this tag |

With `block_tag` omitted the immunity is unconditional and predicted
client-side, so there's no rubberbanding when entering a web. Restricting
it to a tag keeps the check server-authoritative — a brief correction may
be visible.

**Example — immune to all block slowdown:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:no_slowdown",
  "name": "Unimpeded",
  "description": "Not slowed by webs, soul sand, or dense foliage."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:wall_climbing`

Allows the player to cling to and climb any solid wall surface, similar to spiders. Fall damage is suppressed while climbing.

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:wall_climbing",
  "name": "Wall Climbing",
  "description": "Can scale any solid surface."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:elytra_boost`

Allows the player to activate elytra gliding without wearing an elytra. Pressing jump while falling initiates flight.

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:elytra_boost",
  "name": "Elytra Boost",
  "description": "Can glide without equipping an elytra."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:scare_entities`

Causes listed entity types to flee from the player on sight.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `entity_types` | list of Identifier | no | `[]` | Entity types to scare, e.g. `["minecraft:creeper"]` |

**Example — creepers flee from the player:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:scare_entities",
  "entity_types": ["minecraft:creeper", "minecraft:spider"],
  "name": "Predator Aura",
  "description": "Hostile arthropods flee on sight."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:tick_action`

Runs a named action on a repeating interval while the origin is active.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | int | no | `20` | Ticks between action executions (20 ticks = 1 second) |
| `action_type` | string | no | `none` | Action to perform each interval. Currently: `teleport_on_damage`, `none` |

**Example — teleport to safety on damage every 2 seconds:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:tick_action",
  "interval": 40,
  "action_type": "teleport_on_damage",
  "name": "Dimensional Escape",
  "description": "Teleports away when taking damage."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:conditional`

Wraps another power so it only applies when a movement condition is met. The inner power must be a separately defined power that is also listed in the origin's power list.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `condition` | string | no | `always` | `climbing`, `in_water`, `on_ground`, or `always` |
| `inner_power` | Identifier | yes | — | The power to conditionally enable |

**Example — no fall damage only while climbing:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:conditional",
  "condition": "climbing",
  "inner_power": "examplepack:specter_no_fall_base",
  "name": "Spider's Grip",
  "description": "Takes no fall damage while clinging to walls."
}
```

> The `inner_power` must also be listed in the origin's `powers` array for it to be registered. The conditional wrapper activates or suppresses its effect based on the condition.

---

## `neoorigins:phantom_form`

Applies a ghostly state to the player: permanent invisibility and/or removal of gravity.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `invisibility` | bool | no | `true` | Apply permanent Invisibility effect |

  "effects": ["minecraft:poison", "minecraft:wither"],
  "name": "Toxin Resistance",
  "description": "Immune to poison and wither effects."
}
```

  "description": "Emits a faint glow visible to others."
}
```

}
```

---

}
```

---

## `neoorigins:xp_gain_modifier`

No additional fields beyond `name` and `description`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:underwater_mining_speed",

```

---

## `neoorigins:hunger_drain_modifier`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:action_on_event`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Multiplies the rate at which the player's hunger depletes.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `multiplier` | float | no | `1.0` | Hunger drain multiplier (`1.3` = 30% faster, `0.5` = half rate) |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:hunger_drain_modifier",
  "multiplier": 1.3,
  "name": "High Metabolism",
  "description": "Gets hungry faster than normal."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:natural_regen_modifier`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:action_on_event`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Multiplies all healing the player receives via `LivingHealEvent`. **Note:** this is *not* limited to food-tick natural regen — it also scales Regeneration potion ticks, beacon regen, totem of undying, and any data-pack `neoorigins:heal` actions. If you want to cancel food-tick regen specifically while leaving other heals intact, use `neoorigins:no_natural_regen` instead.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `multiplier` | float | no | `1.0` | Heal multiplier (`0.5` = half all heals, `2.0` = double all heals, `0.0` = block all heals) |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:natural_regen_modifier",
  "multiplier": 0.5,
  "name": "Slow Recovery",
  "description": "Heals at half the normal rate."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:no_natural_regen`

Cancels vanilla food-based natural regeneration only. Both regen branches (saturation-based fast regen and food-level-≥18 slow regen) are skipped. Other heal sources — Regeneration potion, beacon, totem, `neoorigins:heal` — still work normally. Pair with an alternate healing mechanic for "metabolism-less" origins like Automaton variants.

No fields. Presence of the power is the entire configuration.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:no_natural_regen",
  "name": "No Pulse",
  "description": "Hunger doesn't restore HP. Only direct healing effects do."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:food_restriction`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:action_on_event`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Restricts which foods the player can eat. Supports `blacklist` (cannot eat items matching the tag/item list) and `whitelist` (can only eat items matching). `item_tag` accepts a single string or a JSON array of tags and/or item IDs. Prefix entries with `#` for tags; bare strings match exact item IDs.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | string | no | `"blacklist"` | `"blacklist"` or `"whitelist"` |
| `item_tag` | string or array | yes | — | Single tag/item or array of tags/items. Use `#` prefix for tags (e.g. `"#minecraft:meat"`), bare strings for item IDs (e.g. `"minecraft:spider_eye"`). |

**Example — meat-only diet (whitelist):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:food_restriction",
  "mode": "whitelist",
  "item_tag": "#minecraft:meat",
  "name": "Carnivore",
  "description": "Can only eat meat."
}
```

**Example — vegetarian with multiple blacklisted tags:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:food_restriction",
  "mode": "blacklist",
  "item_tag": ["#minecraft:meat", "#c:foods/raw_meat"],
  "name": "Vegetarian",
  "description": "Cannot eat meat."
}
```

**Example — blacklist specific items and a tag:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:food_restriction",
  "mode": "blacklist",
  "item_tag": ["#minecraft:meat", "minecraft:spider_eye", "minecraft:rotten_flesh"],
  "name": "Clean Eater",
  "description": "Cannot eat meat or unsanitary foods."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:item_magnetism`

Items on the ground within a radius are pulled toward the player automatically.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `radius` | float | no | `4.0` | Pull radius in blocks |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:item_magnetism",
  "radius": 4.0,
  "name": "Item Attraction",
  "description": "Items on the ground are drawn toward you."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:break_speed_modifier`

Multiplies the player's mining speed when breaking blocks in the specified tag. When no tag is provided, applies to all blocks.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |

## `neoorigins:action_on_hit`

Triggers an action each time the player deals damage to any living entity — mobs, animals, and other players. Optionally restricted by target entity group, target entity type, or damage type. The configured `action` may target the player (self) or the victim.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |

Filters are combined with AND: every configured filter must match for the action to fire. The `chance` roll happens last.

**Example — heal 0.5 hearts on striking any undead:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_on_hit",
  "action": "restore_health",
  "amount": 1.0,
  "target_group": "undead",
  "name": "Smite Vigor",
  "description": "Drains life from the undead with each blow."

  "effect": "minecraft:glowing",
  "duration": 60,

## `neoorigins:regen_in_fluid`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:condition_passive`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

Grants periodic health regeneration while submerged in the specified fluid.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fluid` | string | no | `water` | Fluid to trigger in: `water` or `lava` |
| `heal_amount` | float | no | `1.0` | Health restored per interval |
| `interval_ticks` | int | no | `40` | Ticks between heal pulses |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:regen_in_fluid",
  "fluid": "water",
  "heal_amount": 1.0,
  "interval_ticks": 40,
  "name": "Aquatic Regeneration",
  "description": "Regenerates health while underwater."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:breath_in_fluid`

Drains the player's air supply when their eyes are submerged in the specified fluid. Useful for fire-themed origins that "drown" in water. Surfacing (head above water) restores air normally via vanilla breathing. While submerged, fully overrides vanilla's air management (suppresses both vanilla drowning and water-breathing refill), so the configured drain rate is the sole authority on how fast air depletes. Respiration enchantment extends survival time. Drown damage (2 HP/sec) applies once air is exhausted.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fluid` | string | no | `water` | Fluid: `water` or `lava` |
| `air_loss_per_second` | int | no | — | Intuitive form: how many air points are lost per second. Higher = faster drain. Internally converted to ticks via `20 / value`. |
| `drain_interval_ticks` | int | no | — | Ticks between each air drain. Higher = slower drain. Equivalent to the legacy `drain_rate`. |
| `drain_rate` | int | no | `20` | Legacy alias for `drain_interval_ticks`. Resolution priority: `air_loss_per_second` > `drain_interval_ticks` > `drain_rate` > default 20 (one decrement per second). |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:breath_in_fluid",
  "fluid": "water",
  "air_loss_per_second": 1,
  "name": "Hydrophobic",
  "description": "Cannot breathe in water."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:breath_out_of_fluid`

Drains the player's air supply while they are **not** submerged in the specified fluid — a fish out of water. Once the air supply reaches 0, vanilla drown damage applies. Water Breathing and Conduit Power effects pause the drain, and drinking a water bottle restores half the air bar. Compatible with Create's Copper Backtank (worn in chestplate slot, consumes pressurized air to pause drain). Respiration enchantment extends land time using the same probability curve vanilla uses underwater.

The drain rate is controlled globally by the `ocean_origins.drain_rate_ticks` config option, not the per-power `drain_rate` field.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fluid` | string | no | `water` | Fluid the player must stay in: `water` or `lava` |
| `drain_rate` | int | no | `40` | Legacy field — overridden by `ocean_origins.drain_rate_ticks` config |

**Example — aquatic origin that drowns on land:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:breath_out_of_fluid",
  "fluid": "water",
  "name": "Dries Out",
  "description": "Suffocates when not in water."
}
```

> Pair with `neoorigins:water_breathing` so the player never loses air underwater while the bubble row depletes on land.

| `amplifier` | int | no | `0` | Effect level |

**Example — Speed I in forests:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:biome_buff",
  "biome_tag": "minecraft:is_forest",
  "effect": "minecraft:speed",
  "amplifier": 0,
  "name": "Forest Stride",

  "type": "neoorigins:damage_in_biome",
  "biome_tag": "minecraft:is_nether",
  "damage": 1.0,
  "interval_ticks": 40,
  "name": "Nether Intolerance",

---

## `neoorigins:burn_at_health_threshold`

> **Deprecated in 2.0** — this type is now an alias for `neoorigins:condition_passive`. See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `threshold_percent` | float | no | `0.25` | HP fraction that triggers ignition (e.g. `0.25` = below 25%) |
| `fire_ticks` | int | no | `60` | Duration the player is set on fire |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:burn_at_health_threshold",
  "threshold_percent": 0.25,
  "fire_ticks": 60,
  "name": "Critical Combustion",
  "description": "Catches fire when near death."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:mobs_ignore_player`

Causes specific mob types to ignore the player. By default a retaliation
window applies — once the player hits the mob, the mob may target back
briefly. Set `passive: true` to make the ignore unconditional.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `entity_types` | list of Identifier or `#tag` | no | `[]` | Entity types that will ignore the player. Accepts raw ids (`"minecraft:zombie"`) and tag references (`"#minecraft:skeletons"`). When empty, every mob ignores. |
| `passive` | bool | no | `false` | When true, the ignore is unconditional — even attacking the mob does not provoke retaliation. |

**Example — only creepers ignore (with retaliation):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:mobs_ignore_player",
  "entity_types": ["minecraft:creeper"],
  "name": "Creeper Affinity",
  "description": "Creepers ignore you unless attacked."
}
```

**Example — unprovokable peace with every skeleton (tag + passive):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:mobs_ignore_player",
  "entity_types": ["#minecraft:skeletons"],
  "passive": true,
  "name": "Bonewalker",
  "description": "Skeletons never see you as a threat, no matter what you do."
}
```

> This is distinct from `scare_entities` (which makes mobs flee). `mobs_ignore_player` makes mobs neutral; `scare_entities` makes them run away.

---

## `neoorigins:no_mob_spawns_nearby`

Suppresses mob spawns within a radius of the player. Toggleable — the player can turn the aura on/off via their skill keybind.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `radius` | int | no | `24` | Radius in blocks within which spawns are suppressed. Note: vanilla already blocks `MONSTER`-category natural spawns within 24 blocks of any player (`NaturalSpawner`); use a value above 24 to extend the safe zone meaningfully. |
| `categories` | list of string | no | `["monster"]` | Spawn categories to suppress: `monster`, `creature`, `ambient`, `water_creature`, or `all` |

**Example — suppress hostile spawns in a 36-block radius:**

## `neoorigins:persistent_effect`

Generic condition-gated, toggleable status-effect stack. Part of the 2.0 consolidation: replaces `status_effect`, `stacking_status_effects`, `night_vision`, `glow`, `water_breathing`, `breath_in_fluid`, and the tag branch of `regen_in_fluid` with one type that applies an arbitrary list of mob effects whenever an optional `condition` (an EntityCondition DSL tree) is met.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `effects` | list of EffectSpec | yes | — | Mob effects to apply. See below. May also be a single inline EffectSpec on the top-level object. |
| `condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | DSL condition — effects only apply while it is true. Effects are cleared when it becomes false. |
| `refresh_interval` | int | no | `300` | Ticks each applied effect is (re)granted for. Must be ≥ 1. |
| `toggleable` | bool | no | `true` | When true, this is an active-keybind power: pressing the key toggles effects on/off. When false, effects are always applied while condition is true. |

**`EffectSpec` object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `effect` | Identifier | yes | — | Effect ID, e.g. `minecraft:strength` (alias `id` also accepted) |
| `amplifier` | int | no | `0` | Effect level |
| `ambient` | bool | no | `true` | Ambient particles (low visibility) |
| `show_particles` | bool | no | `false` | Whether to show particles |
| `show_icon` | bool | no | `true` | Whether to show the HUD icon |

> **Root cascade:** `show_icon`, `show_particles`, and `ambient` placed at the power root (alongside `type`/`effects`) cascade as defaults onto every nested `EffectSpec` that does not declare its own value. This lets you set HUD/particle visibility once for the whole stack instead of repeating it per effect.

**Example — permanent always-on Weakness II:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:persistent_effect",
  "effect": "minecraft:weakness",
  "amplifier": 1,
  "toggleable": false,
  "name": "Frail",
  "description": "Permanently weakened."
}
```

**Example — Strength + Haste while in water (conditional, not toggleable):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:persistent_effect",
  "toggleable": false,
  "condition": { "type": "neoorigins:in_water" },
  "effects": [
    { "effect": "minecraft:strength", "amplifier": 0 },
    { "effect": "minecraft:haste",    "amplifier": 1 }
  ],
  "name": "Tidecaller",
  "description": "Empowered while immersed in water."
}
```

Effects are re-applied every `refresh_interval` ticks (default 300 = 15 seconds), so the effect never expires. When `toggleable` is true (the default), the player can press their skill key to toggle effects on/off — set `toggleable: false` for effects that should always be active. A single effect can be specified inline on the top-level object (`effect`, `amplifier`, etc.) instead of using the `effects` list.

## `neoorigins:modify_food_nutrition`

Overrides the nutrition (hunger) value of food the player eats. Matching food gives exactly the configured number of hunger points regardless of its original value. Saturation is scaled proportionally. Use `food_item` or `food_tag` to filter which foods are affected — if neither is set, ALL food is affected.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `nutrition` | int | no | `1` | Fixed hunger points matching food gives |
| `food_item` | Identifier | no | — | Only affect this specific item (e.g. `minecraft:sweet_berries`) |
| `food_tag` | string | no | — | Only affect items in this tag (e.g. `#minecraft:meat`). Supports `#` prefix. |

**Example — all food gives 1 hunger point:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_food_nutrition",
  "nutrition": 1,
  "name": "Picky Eater",
  "description": "Gains almost no nutrition from food."
}
```

**Example — meat gives 8 hunger points:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_food_nutrition",
  "nutrition": 8,
  "food_tag": "#minecraft:meat",
  "name": "Carnivore",
  "description": "Thrives on meat."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:condition_passive`

Generic condition-gated periodic action — "a passive with a trigger". Part of the 2.0 consolidation: collapses `biome_buff`, `damage_in_biome`, `damage_in_daylight`, `damage_in_water`, `burn_at_health_threshold`, `mobs_ignore_player`, `no_mob_spawns_nearby`, and `item_magnetism` into a single type. Also supersedes `tick_action` when `condition` is omitted.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | int | no | `20` | Tick interval between evaluations (clamped to ≥ 1) |
| `condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | DSL condition to test each interval |
| `entity_action` | EntityAction | no | noop | Action run against the player when condition is true |
| `else_action` | EntityAction | no | noop | Action run when condition is false |

See [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) / the Apoli compat docs for the full condition and action DSL.

**Example — take 1 damage every 2 seconds in the Nether:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:condition_passive",
  "interval": 40,
  "condition": {
    "type": "neoorigins:in_tag",
    "tag": "minecraft:is_nether"
  },
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "neoorigins:damage",
    "amount": 1.0,
    "source": "fire"
  },
  "name": "Nether Intolerance",
  "description": "Burns while in the Nether."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:action_on_event`

The 2.0 generic event hook — fires an action and/or applies a float modifier when a named player event occurs. Replaces 20+ bespoke Origins-Classes hook powers (`better_enchanting`, `more_smoker_xp`, `crop_harvest_bonus`, `break_speed_modifier`, `natural_regen_modifier`, `action_on_kill`, `action_on_hit_taken`, `thorns_aura`, `knockback_modifier`, `hunger_drain_modifier`, `food_restriction`, …) with one configurable type.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `event` | string | yes | — | Event name (case-insensitive). See [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for the full list. |
| `condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | DSL gate — the event only fires when this is true |
| `entity_action` | EntityAction | no | noop | Side-effect run when the event fires |
| `modifier` | FloatModifier or list | no | identity | Float modifier applied to the event's numeric payload (for modifier-style events) |
| `block_condition` | BlockCondition | no | — | Block-position gate for block events (`block_break`, `block_place`, `block_use`). Ignored on other events. |
| `effect` | id | no | — | `effect_applied` only: pre-dispatch filter on this exact effect id. |
| `effect_tag` | tag id | no | — | `effect_applied` only: pre-dispatch filter on this effect tag (leading `#` optional). OR-matched with `effect`. |
| `immunity_ticks` | int ≥ 0 | no | 0 | `effect_applied` only: after a successful cancel, grant this many ticks of full immunity to the same effect id before re-rolling. |

**Event categories (see [EVENTS.md](EVENTS.md) for the full list):**

- Lifecycle: `GAINED`, `REVOKED`, `RESPAWN`, `GAMEMODE_CHANGE`
- Combat: `KILL`, `HIT_TAKEN`, `DAMAGE_DEALT`, `MOD_KNOCKBACK`, `MOD_THORNS`
- Food: `FOOD_EATEN`, `MOD_FOOD_NUTRITION`, `MOD_EXHAUSTION`, `MOD_NATURAL_REGEN`
- Mining / crafting: `BLOCK_BREAK`, `CRAFT_ITEM`, `ITEM_USE_FINISH`, `MOD_BREAK_SPEED`, `MOD_CRAFT_COUNT`
- XP / economy: `XP_GAINED`, `MOD_XP_GAIN`, `TRADE_COMPLETE`, `MOD_BONEMEAL_GROWTH`
- Interaction: `BLOCK_INTERACT`, `ENTITY_INTERACT`, `RIGHT_CLICK_ITEM`
- Status effects: `EFFECT_APPLIED`

For action-style events set `entity_action`; for modifier-style events set `modifier`. A single power may declare both — the action path fires on `dispatch` sites and the modifier path chains on `dispatchModifier` sites.

**Example — heal 1 heart on kill only while holding a wooden sword:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_on_event",
  "event": "kill",
  "condition": {
    "type": "neoorigins:equipped_item",
    "slot": "mainhand",
    "item": "minecraft:wooden_sword"
  },
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "neoorigins:heal",
    "amount": 2.0
  },
  "name": "Wooden Vampire",
  "description": "Regain health on kills, but only with a wooden sword."
}
```

**Example — 30% faster natural regen:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_on_event",
  "event": "mod_natural_regen",
  "modifier": {
    "operation": "multiply_base",
    "value": 1.3
  }
}
```

**Example — 90% probabilistic resistance to a third-party infection effect, with 2s of full immunity after each cleanse:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_on_event",
  "event": "effect_applied",
  "effect": "spore:mycelium_ef",
  "condition": { "type": "neoorigins:random_chance", "chance": 0.9 },
  "entity_action": { "type": "neoorigins:cancel_event" },
  "immunity_ticks": 40
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:invulnerability`

Native invulnerability power — cancels incoming damage whose source matches any configured filter. If every filter list is empty, blocks all incoming damage. Replaces the lossy 1.x translation that only covered `FIRE`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `damage_types` | list of string | no | `[]` | Damage type IDs (e.g. `minecraft:fall`) — matched by ID |
| `damage_tags` | list of string | no | `[]` | Damage type tag IDs (e.g. `minecraft:is_fire`) |
| `msg_ids` | list of string | no | `[]` | Vanilla damage msgId strings (e.g. `inFire`, `fall`) — covers loose Origins-style names |

Filters combine with OR: a damage source is cancelled if it matches any entry in any list. If all three lists are empty, all damage is cancelled (matching Origins' behaviour when `damage_condition` is omitted).

**Example — fire and lava immunity:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:invulnerability",
  "damage_tags": ["minecraft:is_fire"],
  "name": "Inferno Blood",
  "description": "Immune to fire and lava."
}
```

**Example — block everything:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:invulnerability",
  "name": "Adamant",
  "description": "Cannot be harmed."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:size_scaling`

Scales the player's visual and collision size via the `minecraft:generic.scale` attribute. Optionally also scales block/entity interaction reach. Mirrors the scale to Pehkui when the mod is present so cross-mod queries see a consistent value.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `scale` | float | no | `1.0` | Target scale multiplier (`0.5` = half size, `2.0` = double) |
| `modify_reach` | bool | no | `true` | Also adjust block/entity interaction reach proportionally |

**Example — half-size origin:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:size_scaling",
  "scale": 0.5,
  "modify_reach": true,
  "name": "Tiny",
  "description": "Half-sized, with proportionally shorter reach."
}
```

The scale attribute uses `ADD_VALUE` against a base of `1.0` (so delta = `scale - 1.0`); reach attributes use `ADD_MULTIPLIED_BASE` so reach tracks visual size. Missing attributes (older MC or NeoForge versions) log a single warning and the power silently skips that attribute.

---

## `neoorigins:entity_set`

Pure data-holder power. Its presence in a player's active power set declares that the player participates in a named UUID set. Actual set storage lives on `PlayerOriginData`; the `neoorigins:in_set` / `neoorigins:add_to_set` / `neoorigins:remove_from_set` verbs read and mutate it.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | no | `""` | Name of the UUID set this power declares. Conventionally namespaced like `mypack:kill_streak`. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:entity_set",
  "name": "mypack:hunted",
  "name_text": "Marked Prey",
  "description": "Tracks entities marked as hunted by this origin."
}
```

The colon in `name` is allowed and carries no mechanical meaning — it's a soft convention for avoiding collisions between packs. Pair this with `action_on_event` (to add entries) and `condition_passive` or direct DSL predicates (to query membership).

---

## `neoorigins:enhanced_vision`

> **Status (2.0.8):** still available for direct authoring, but the 22
> built-in origins that briefly used `enhanced_vision` in 2.0.4–2.0.7
> are temporarily back on `neoorigins:night_vision` while we sort out
> shader and mod-compat issues with the LightTexture path. The cleaner
> enhanced-vision look is still the long-term direction; this is a
> rollback for stability, not a deprecation.

Passive low-light vision: emits an `enhanced_vision` capability tag and scales the client brightness curve directly via a `LightTexture` mixin. Unlike the full `minecraft:night_vision` status effect, there's no screen tint, HUD icon, or max-brightness ramp at end of duration — just exposure-style compensation.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exposure` | float (0.0–1.0) | no | `0.7` | Target brightness scalar (advisory in v1 — the client mixin currently hardcodes 0.7) |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:enhanced_vision",
  "exposure": 0.7,
  "name": "Cat Eyes",
  "description": "Sees clearly in dim light without the green tint."
}
```

All exposure work happens on the logical client; the server only publishes the capability tag. If per-origin variance is needed later, the value will be wired through a client-synced power-config payload.

---

## `neoorigins:edible_item`

Makes arbitrary items consumable on right-click. A matching item is instantly consumed: the configured nutrition/saturation is applied, one is removed from the stack, and an `action_on_event.ITEM_USE_FINISH` dispatch fires with the stack as context. Bypasses vanilla FoodProperties so pack authors can declare "Merling eats raw fish" or "Phantom eats rotten flesh for full food" without replacing the item's data components.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | list of Identifier | no | `[]` | Exact item IDs that qualify |
| `tags` | list of Identifier | no | `[]` | Item tag IDs that qualify |
| `nutrition` | int | no | `4` | Food points restored (1 shank = 2) |
| `saturation` | float | no | `0.3` | Saturation restored |
| `always_edible` | bool | no | `true` | If true, can be eaten at full hunger |
| `consume_sound` | Identifier | no | _(none)_ | Optional sound ID played on consume |

At least one of `items` or `tags` should be non-empty, otherwise nothing will ever match. Matching is inclusive — an item qualifies if it appears in either list.

**Example — Merling eats raw fish at full food:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:edible_item",
  "tags": ["minecraft:fishes"],
  "nutrition": 4,
  "saturation": 0.4,
  "always_edible": true,
  "name": "Pescivore",
  "description": "Can eat raw fish at any time."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:restrict_armor`

Prevents certain items from being equipped in certain slots. When a matching item is placed in a restricted slot, the power ejects it back to the player's inventory (or drops it to the ground if inventory is full).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `restrictions` | list of SlotRestriction | no | `[]` | Per-slot filters. An empty list disables the power. |

**`SlotRestriction` object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `slot` | string | yes | One of `mainhand`, `offhand`, `head`, `chest`, `legs`, `feet`, `body` |
| `item` | Identifier | no | Exact item ID to restrict |
| `tag` | Identifier | no | Item tag to restrict |

If neither `item` nor `tag` is set on a restriction entry, any non-empty stack in that slot is restricted.

**Example — no iron or diamond chestplates:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:restrict_armor",
  "restrictions": [
    { "slot": "chest", "item": "minecraft:iron_chestplate" },
    { "slot": "chest", "item": "minecraft:diamond_chestplate" }
  ],
  "name": "Light Armor Only",
  "description": "Cannot wear iron or diamond chestplates."
}
```

### Armor classes

NeoOrigins ships two item tags that categorize vanilla armor into **light** and **heavy** classes. Use these with `restrict_armor` to broadly gate what an origin can wear without listing every item individually.

| Tag | Contents |
|---|---|
| `neoorigins:light_armor` | Leather, Chainmail (all slots) |
| `neoorigins:heavy_armor` | Iron, Gold, Diamond, Netherite (all slots) |

**Example — restrict an origin to light armor only:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:restrict_armor",
  "restrictions": [
    { "slot": "head",  "tag": "neoorigins:heavy_armor" },
    { "slot": "chest", "tag": "neoorigins:heavy_armor" },
    { "slot": "legs",  "tag": "neoorigins:heavy_armor" },
    { "slot": "feet",  "tag": "neoorigins:heavy_armor" }
  ],
  "name": "Light Armor Only",
  "description": "Cannot wear heavy armor."
}
```

**Adding modded armor to a class:**

Modpack authors can extend the classes in two ways:

1. **Datapack** — add entries to the `neoorigins:heavy_armor` or `neoorigins:light_armor` item tags via a higher-priority datapack.

2. **Config** — add item IDs or `#tags` to the `[armor_classes]` section in `config/neoorigins-common.toml`:

```toml
[armor_classes]
    # Items/tags added here supplement the neoorigins:heavy_armor tag
    heavy_armor = ["modid:steel_chestplate", "#modid:titanium_armor"]
    # Items/tags added here supplement the neoorigins:light_armor tag
    light_armor = ["modid:cloth_robe"]
```

Config entries are checked alongside the tags — items in either source count as that armor class.

---

## `neoorigins:keep_inventory`

On death, selectively retain inventory items matching the power's filters. Matching items are removed from drops and restored to the player's inventory on respawn.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `slots` | list of string | no | `["*"]` | Slot categories to keep from: `hotbar`, `main`, `armor`, `offhand`, `all` (alias `*`). `main` also includes `hotbar`. |
| `items` | list of Identifier | no | `[]` | Specific items to keep |
| `tags` | list of Identifier | no | `[]` | Item tags to keep |

If both `items` and `tags` are empty, every item in the configured slots is kept.

**Example — always keep tools:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:keep_inventory",
  "slots": ["main", "hotbar", "offhand"],
  "tags": ["minecraft:pickaxes", "minecraft:swords", "minecraft:axes", "minecraft:shovels"],
  "name": "Tool Preservation",
  "description": "Tools are never dropped on death."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:modify_player_spawn`

Overrides the player's respawn location to a power-configured target. Unlike the origin's `spawn_location` (first-join and bed-less respawn only), this power fires on every respawn. Optionally also overrides the bed/respawn-anchor spawn point.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `location` | LocationCondition | yes | — | Target location descriptor — `dimension` / `biome` / `biome_tag` / `structure` / `structure_tag`. See `attribute_modifier`'s `location_condition` for the shape. |
| `override_bed` | bool | no | `false` | When true, also overrides bed/respawn-anchor spawn. When false, respects a valid bed/anchor and only fires if none is set. |

**Example — always respawn in an End city:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:modify_player_spawn",
  "location": {
    "dimension": "minecraft:the_end",
    "structure": "minecraft:end_city"
  },
  "override_bed": true,
  "name": "Void-Bound",
  "description": "Always respawns in the nearest End city."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:toggle`

A bare, stateless boolean power — purely a data-holder whose state lives in `CompatAttachments.toggleState()` keyed by the registered id. Unlike `active_ability`, `toggle` does not consume a keybind slot; it's a named boolean other powers gate on.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `default` | bool | no | `false` | Value reads see before the toggle has ever been flipped on this player. Set `true` for "on until flipped off." |

Read the current value with `neoorigins:power_active { power: "mypack:my_toggle" }`. Flip it with `neoorigins:toggle { power: "mypack:my_toggle" }` (optionally `value: true/false` to set explicitly).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:toggle",
  "default": false,
  "hidden": true,
  "name": "Hunter's Mark",
  "description": "Internal flag gated by other powers."
}
```

`hidden: true` keeps the toggle out of the origin info panel — recommended for any purely-internal flag a player doesn't need to see listed.

See [COOKBOOK.md → Toggleable abilities (no keybind slot)](COOKBOOK.md#toggleable-abilities-no-keybind-slot) for full recipes.

---

## `neoorigins:active_ability`

Generic cooldown-gated active (keybind) ability. Part of the 2.0 consolidation — collapses `active_teleport`, `active_dash`, `active_launch`, `active_recall`, `active_swap`, `active_fireball`, `active_bolt`, `active_phase`, `active_place_block`, `healing_mist`, `repulse`, `active_aoe_effect`, and others into one type whose effect is described by an `entity_action` tree.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `60` | Cooldown after each use |
| `hunger_cost` | int | no | `0` | Food points removed per use (1 shank = 2 points). Silently aborts if player has less food (cooldown not consumed). |
| `entity_action` | EntityAction | yes | noop | Action tree fired on use (typically `neoorigins:and { actions: [...] }`) |
| `condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | DSL gate — skips firing (and the cooldown) if false |

Each `active_ability` power maintains an **independent cooldown**. Multiple active abilities on the same origin do not share a cooldown counter — triggering one ability does not block another.

Actions and conditions are compiled once at power-load time via `ActionParser` / `ConditionParser`; runtime only dispatches through the compiled closures.

Hunger gating is handled at the `AbstractActivePower` base class level — when `hunger_cost > 0`, the base checks and debits food before calling `execute`. Any power that extends `AbstractActivePower` and wires `hungerCost()` through its Codec inherits the behavior automatically.

**Example — launch the player upward:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:active_ability",
  "cooldown_ticks": 80,
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "neoorigins:add_velocity",
    "y": 2.0,
    "client": true,
    "server": true
  },
  "name": "Leap",
  "description": "Launches the player upward."
}
```

Legacy active types (`active_teleport`, `active_dash`, etc.) remain registered during the deprecation window. The `migrateLegacyPowers` gradle task can rewrite pack JSON to this type; `LegacyPowerTypeAliases` covers unmigrated JSON once per-type field remappers are landed.

---

## `neoorigins:ground_slam`

Active AoE slam — damages and knocks back every entity within radius.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `damage` | float | no | `6.0` | Damage dealt to each entity |
| `knockback_strength` | float | no | `1.5` | Radial knockback strength |
| `radius` | double | no | `6.0` | Effect radius in blocks |
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `120` | Cooldown after each use |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:ground_slam",
  "damage": 6.0,
  "radius": 6.0,
  "cooldown_ticks": 120,
  "name": "Tectonic Slam",
  "description": "Crushes nearby enemies with a shockwave."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:tidal_wave`

Cone-shaped water blast in the player's look direction. Knocks back and damages entities caught in the wave.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `damage` | float | no | `4.0` | Damage per hit |
| `knockback_strength` | float | no | `2.0` | Forward knockback strength |
| `range` | double | no | `8.0` | Maximum wave distance |
| `cone_angle` | double | no | `60.0` | Total cone angle in degrees (30° to each side of look axis) |
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `100` | Cooldown after each use |
| `hunger_cost` | int | no | `0` | Food points removed per use |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:tidal_wave",
  "damage": 4.0,
  "range": 8.0,
  "cone_angle": 60.0,
  "cooldown_ticks": 100,
  "name": "Tidal Wave",
  "description": "Blasts enemies with a cone of water."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:summon_minion`

Active power that summons a mob near the player. Summoned mobs are tracked with caps, despawn timers, and death-damage feedback. Equipment can be configured per slot; all equipment drop chances are zeroed so summoned mobs never drop loot.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mob_type` | Identifier | yes | — | Entity type to summon, e.g. `minecraft:zombie` |
| `max_count` | int | no | `3` | Maximum concurrent minions per player per mob_type |
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `200` | Cooldown after each summon |
| `hunger_cost` | int | no | `4` | Food points consumed per summon |
| `despawn_ticks` | int | no | `18000` | Lifespan after spawn (15 min default) |
| `death_damage` | float | no | `1.0` | Damage taken by the owner when a minion dies |
| `head` / `chest` / `legs` / `feet` / `mainhand` / `offhand` | Identifier | no | _(none or iron helmet for head)_ | Equipment per slot |

If `head` is unset, the minion gets an iron helmet by default (sun protection for undead). All drop chances are set to 0.

**Example — zombie minion with sword:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:summon_minion",
  "mob_type": "minecraft:zombie",
  "max_count": 3,
  "cooldown_ticks": 200,
  "hunger_cost": 4,
  "mainhand": "minecraft:iron_sword",
  "name": "Raise Dead",
  "description": "Summons a zombie minion to fight for you."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:tame_mob`

Active power that tames a hostile mob the player is looking at. The mob's AI is rewritten to follow the player and target whatever recently hurt the owner. Tamed mobs are tracked via MinionTracker.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `range` | double | no | `16.0` | Max raycast distance to a target |
| `max_tamed` | int | no | `4` | Maximum concurrently-tamed mobs per player |
| `cooldown_ticks` | int | no | `200` | Cooldown after each use |
| `hunger_cost` | int | no | `3` | Food points consumed per tame |
| `despawn_ticks` | int | no | `36000` | Lifespan of each tamed mob (30 min default) |
| `death_damage` | float | no | `0.5` | Damage taken by owner when a tamed mob dies |
| `hostile_only` | bool | no | `true` | If `true`, only hostile mobs (implementing `Enemy`) can be tamed — the Monster Tamer default. Set to `false` to allow taming any non-player `Mob` (animals, golems, villagers, etc.). |

Target must be a non-player `Mob`. With the default `hostile_only: true`, only mobs implementing `Enemy` qualify (villagers, animals, and passive mobs won't tame); set `hostile_only: false` to drop that restriction. Bosses are always rejected via a `canUsePortal` check.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:tame_mob",
  "range": 16.0,
  "max_tamed": 4,
  "cooldown_ticks": 200,

{
  "type": "neoorigins:rare_wandering_loot",
  "name": "Curio Magnet",
  "description": "Wandering traders bring rarer wares while you're around."

  "name": "Shadow Tread",
  "description": "Mobs notice you from much closer than usual."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:stealth`

After sneaking continuously for a threshold number of ticks, the player gains Invisibility. The effect clears when sneaking stops. Toggleable off via keybind.

}
```

---

## `neoorigins:craft_amount_bonus`

# Pack-author patterns

Recipes that compose existing power types to cover use cases the built-in types don't expose directly. Most rely on the Apoli compat surface (`neoorigins:`-prefixed types handled by `OriginsCompatPowerLoader`).

## Periodic feed / heal via `neoorigins:action_over_time`

NeoOrigins' built-in `neoorigins:tick_action` only ships a hardcoded `TELEPORT_ON_DAMAGE` behaviour. For any other periodic action — periodically restore hunger, heal a fixed amount, apply an effect, run an arbitrary entity-action — use `neoorigins:action_over_time` from the Apoli compat layer.

**Periodic hunger restoration** (e.g. for an origin that doesn't eat conventionally):
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_over_time",
  "interval": 40,
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "neoorigins:feed",
    "food": 1,
    "saturation": 0.2
  }
}
```

**Periodic healing** (independent of food / `natural_regen_modifier`):
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:action_over_time",
  "interval": 60,
  "entity_action": {
    "type": "neoorigins:heal",
    "amount": 0.5
  }
}
```

`interval` is in ticks (20 = 1 second). The `entity_action` runs against the player. Any verb supported by `ActionParser` works (`neoorigins:apply_effect`, `neoorigins:damage`, `neoorigins:execute_command`, `neoorigins:if_else` for conditional wrapping, etc.).

## `neoorigins:cobweb_affinity`

Spider-like mobility through cobwebs. Emits the `cobweb_affinity` capability tag — `EntityMakeStuckInBlockMixin` reads it to suppress the usual slowdown inside cobwebs, and `MovementPowerEvents.onBreakSpeed` reads it to multiply cobweb break speed by 10×.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (no fields) | — | — | — | Marker power. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:cobweb_affinity",
  "name": "Spider Affinity",
  "description": "Move and break cobwebs easily."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:hide_hud_bar`

Hides a HUD bar while the power is active. Emits `hide_hunger_bar` or `hide_air_bar` capability tags — `GuiHudBarsMixin` reads them to cancel the matching render call. Governed server-side by the `hide_hud_bars` common config (default true); if disabled, the power registers but the HUD still renders.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bar` | string | no | `"hunger"` | Which bar to hide. `"hunger"` / `"food"` hide the hunger bar; `"air"` / `"oxygen"` / `"breath"` hide the air bar. Any other value is a no-op. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:hide_hud_bar",
  "bar": "air",
  "name": "No Need to Breathe",
  "hidden": true
}
```

Typically paired with `neoorigins:water_breathing` or the Automaton pattern so the hidden bar is also being suppressed mechanically — hiding a bar that still ticks is disorienting.

---

## `neoorigins:particle`

Spawns vanilla particles on the player at a fixed cadence. Server-side `ServerLevel.sendParticles` packetizes to nearby clients, so this works on dedicated servers without a client-side mixin.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `particle` | string \| object | yes | — | Registry id of any `SimpleParticleType` (e.g. `"minecraft:end_rod"`). For parameterized particles use the object form: `{ "type": "minecraft:dust", "color": [1.0, 0.85, 0.2], "scale": 0.6 }` |
| `frequency` | int | no | `8` | Emit every N server ticks. Lower = denser. |
| `count` | int | no | `1` | Particles per emission. |
| `spread` | `[x, y, z]` floats | no | `[0.25, 0.5, 0.25]` | Random offset spread per particle. |
| `offset` | `[x, y, z]` floats | no | `[0.0, 1.0, 0.0]` | Origin offset from player feet (defaults to ~chest height). |
| `speed` | float | no | `0.0` | Vanilla "speed" parameter — passes through to `sendParticles`. Most particle types use this as initial-velocity scale; some ignore it. |
| `condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | Optional gate evaluated each emission tick. |

The Origins/Apoli `:particle` power type is auto-translated to this — packs that already use `neoorigins:particle`, `apoli:particle`, `apace:particle`, or `apugli:particle` work without modification (`frequency` and `particle` fields map 1:1).

**Example — ambient sparkle aura:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:particle",
  "particle": "minecraft:end_rod",
  "frequency": 6,
  "count": 1,
  "spread": [0.4, 0.6, 0.4],
  "name": "Blessed Aura",
  "description": "Faint sparkles trail you wherever you walk."
}
```

**Example — colored gold dust, water-only:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:particle",
  "particle": { "type": "minecraft:dust", "color": [1.0, 0.85, 0.2], "scale": 0.6 },
  "frequency": 10,
  "count": 2,
  "condition": { "type": "neoorigins:in_water" },
  "name": "Gilded Wake"
}
```

Sparkle-aesthetic vanilla particle picks: `minecraft:end_rod` (cleanest white twinkle), `minecraft:firework` (bright sparks, heavier), `minecraft:enchant` (swirling glyphs), `minecraft:wax_on` (puff burst), `minecraft:scrape` (copper sparks), `minecraft:totem_of_undying` (green/gold festive), `minecraft:glow` (Allay-style soft dots), `minecraft:nautilus` (subtle blue specs).

---

## `neoorigins:ender_gaze_immunity`

Endermen do not aggro when the player looks at them. Emits the `ender_gaze_immunity` capability tag — an Enderman targeting mixin reads it to skip the usual line-of-sight check.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (no fields) | — | — | — | Marker power. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:ender_gaze_immunity",
  "name": "Void Gaze",
  "description": "Endermen ignore your gaze."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:natural_glide`

Grants elytra-style gliding without needing to equip an elytra. Press jump while falling to start fall-flying, exactly as if the player were wearing one.

Emits the `natural_glide` capability tag. The `PlayerStartFallFlyingMixin` reads it at the head of `Player.tryToStartFallFlying` and bypasses the standard chest-slot elytra check, calling `startFallFlying()` directly.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (no fields) | — | — | — | Marker power. |

**Example — Phantom spectral wings:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:natural_glide",
  "name": "Spectral Wings",
  "description": "Glide like an elytra user — no item required. Press jump while falling to spread your wings."
}
```

Preconditions match vanilla: not on ground, not already fall-flying, not in water, not levitating. Pair with `neoorigins:elytra_boost` for a full glide + launch-boost kit.

Contrast with `neoorigins:flight` — flight is creative-mode-style (hold space to ascend, fly freely). `natural_glide` is pitch-based gliding like a real elytra user.

---

## `neoorigins:bare_hand_tool`

Makes the player's empty hand behave like a specific vanilla tool for block-break purposes — tool-tier drop eligibility **and** break speed both match the configured tool item. Point at any tool item ID and the runtime looks up its tool component to determine which blocks qualify and at what speed.

Emits a capability tag of the form `bare_hand_tool:<tool_id>` (e.g. `bare_hand_tool:minecraft:stone_pickaxe`) — the tool ID is encoded in the tag so the client-side break-speed predictor and the server-side harvest check can both reach the answer without extra sync state. Wired via `BareHandToolEvents` on the NeoForge event bus (`PlayerEvent.HarvestCheck` + `PlayerEvent.BreakSpeed`). No mixins required.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tool` | Identifier | no | `minecraft:stone_pickaxe` | Any vanilla tool item ID. Determines both break-speed and drop-eligibility. |

**Example — Caveborn mines like a stone pickaxe with bare hands:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:bare_hand_tool",
  "tool": "minecraft:stone_pickaxe",
  "name": "Stone Fists",
  "description": "Bare hands mine like a stone pickaxe — break ores and stone without tools."
}
```

An origin can stack multiple instances to emulate several tool types simultaneously (e.g. a miner + lumberjack hybrid with both a pickaxe and an axe instance). When the player's hand is empty the event handler iterates all active `bare_hand_tool` capabilities and picks the first that can correctly harvest the target — different tool types don't conflict.

Only fires when the main hand is empty. Holding any item delegates to vanilla behaviour normally.

---

## `neoorigins:fortune_when_effect`

Applies a virtual Fortune-level drop multiplier whenever a configured `MobEffect` is active on the player. The vanilla `ApplyBonusCount.ORE_DROPS` formula is used, giving the same rolling distribution as a real Fortune N pickaxe (`count × (max(0, random(level + 2) - 1) + 1)`).

Deliberately generic — any origin can emulate an enchantment-like buff by pairing this with any MobEffect (e.g. Caveborn's Mining Fortune is gated by `minecraft:luck` granted via eating diamond). Wired via `FortuneEffectEvents` subscribing to `BlockDropsEvent` server-side.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `effect` | Identifier | no | `minecraft:luck` | The gating MobEffect ID. Bonus only applies while this effect is active on the player. |
| `level` | int | no | `2` | Virtual Fortune level to roll. Higher = more extra drops. |
| `target` | string | no | `#c:ores` | Block tag the bonus applies to. Use `#tagname` syntax. Defaults to the NeoForge common ores tag; pack authors can narrow to a vanilla sub-tag like `#minecraft:diamond_ores` or a custom tag. |

**Vanilla parity:** `minecraft:ancient_debris` is hardcoded-excluded because netherite is the single vanilla ore that ignores Fortune. Every other vanilla ore (iron, gold, copper, coal, diamond, emerald, lapis, redstone, nether_gold, nether_quartz) is covered by `#c:ores` and will roll the bonus normally.

**Example — Caveborn Mining Fortune (gated by Luck from eating diamond):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:fortune_when_effect",
  "effect": "minecraft:luck",
  "level": 2,
  "target": "#c:ores",
  "name": "Mining Fortune",
  "description": "While Luck is active, ore blocks drop as if mined with Fortune II."
}
```

Stacking isn't additive — only the first matching power fires per break. Author variants as separate powers with different effect gates rather than expecting them to compound.

---

## `neoorigins:dodge_chance`

Percentage chance to completely dodge incoming damage. When triggered, the damage event is cancelled entirely. Applied via `CombatPowerEvents`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `chance` | float | no | `0.15` | Dodge probability (0.0–1.0). 0.15 = 15% dodge. |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:dodge_chance",
  "chance": 0.2,
  "name": "Evasion",
  "description": "20% chance to dodge incoming attacks."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:thorns_on_hit`

Passive thorns — when the player takes melee damage, the attacker takes damage back. Optionally sets the attacker on fire. Applied via `CombatPowerEvents`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `damage` | float | no | `2.0` | Thorns damage dealt to the attacker. |
| `fire_ticks` | int | no | `0` | Fire ticks applied to the attacker (0 = no fire). |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:thorns_on_hit",
  "damage": 3.0,
  "fire_ticks": 40,
  "name": "Ember Thorns",
  "description": "Melee attackers take 3 damage and catch fire."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:light_level_effect`

Applies a status effect when the player is at or below a certain light level. Removes the effect when they move to brighter light.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| `show_particles` | boolean | no | `false` | Show effect particles. |
| `show_icon` | boolean | no | `false` | Show effect icon on HUD. |

**Example — invisibility in darkness:**
```json

  "type": "neoorigins:light_level_effect",
  "max_light_level": 4,
  "effect": "minecraft:invisibility",
  "name": "Shadow Meld",
  "description": "Become invisible in darkness."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:low_hp_threshold`

Applies one or more status effects when the player's HP drops below a percentage threshold. Effects are removed when HP rises above the threshold.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `threshold` | float | no | `0.5` | HP fraction (0.0–1.0). 0.5 = below 50%. |
| `effects` | list of `{ effect, amplifier }` | yes | — | Effects to apply while below threshold. |

**Example — berserker rage below 25% HP:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:low_hp_threshold",
  "threshold": 0.25,
  "effects": [
    { "effect": "minecraft:strength", "amplifier": 1 },
    { "effect": "minecraft:speed", "amplifier": 0 }
  ],
  "name": "Death's Embrace",
  "description": "Gain Strength II and Speed below 25% HP."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:burn`

Sets the player on fire at a configurable interval. Used for origins that are perpetually burning or catch fire under certain conditions (pair with a `condition` on the power JSON to gate on daylight, biome, etc.).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | int | no | `20` | Ticks between fire applications. |
| `burn_duration` | int | no | `100` | Fire duration in ticks per application. |

Origins compat: translates `origins:burn`.

**Example — smoulder in sunlight:**

  "burn_duration": 60,
  "condition": { "type": "neoorigins:exposed_to_sun" },
  "name": "Sun Scorch",
  "description": "Burns when exposed to direct sunlight."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:walk_on_fluid`

| `fluid` | string | no | `both` | Which fluid to walk on: `water`, `lava`, or `both` |

**Example — walk on water:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:walk_on_fluid",
  "fluid": "water",
  "name": "Water Walking",
  "description": "Can walk on water surfaces."
}
```

Origins compat: translates `origins:walk_on_fluid`.

---

## `neoorigins:extra_inventory`

Gives the player an extra inventory opened via the skill keybind. Uses vanilla's chest UI, dynamically sized to fit the configured slot count (1-6 rows). Contents are persisted across sessions.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |

## `neoorigins:ignore_water`

Makes the player unaffected by water: full movement speed in water (via `water_movement_efficiency` attribute) and immune to water-current pushing (via `EntityIgnoreWaterMixin`). Emits the `ignore_water` capability tag.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (no fields) | — | — | — | Marker power. |

Origins compat: translates `origins:ignore_water`.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:ignore_water",
  "name": "Hydrophobic",
  "description": "Water doesn't slow you down or push you around."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:overlay`

Renders a full-screen texture overlay on the player's HUD. Client-side only — the server emits a capability tag encoding the texture path and strength; `VisualEffectsHandler` on the client reads it and draws the overlay.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `texture` | resource location | yes | — | Overlay texture (e.g. `"minecraft:textures/misc/pumpkinblur.png"`). |
| `strength` | float | no | `1.0` | Opacity (0.0 = invisible, 1.0 = fully opaque). |

Origins compat: translates `origins:overlay`.

**Example — dim vignette:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:overlay",
  "texture": "minecraft:textures/misc/pumpkinblur.png",
  "strength": 0.3,
  "name": "Tunnel Vision",
  "description": "Your peripheral vision is dimmed."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:model_color`

Tints the player model with an RGBA colour. Client-side rendering applies a colour multiply via `RenderSystem.setShaderColor` during the player render pass.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `red` | float | no | `1.0` | Red channel (0.0–1.0). |
| `green` | float | no | `1.0` | Green channel (0.0–1.0). |
| `blue` | float | no | `1.0` | Blue channel (0.0–1.0). |
| `alpha` | float | no | `1.0` | Alpha channel (0.0–1.0). |
| `condition` | object | no | — | EntityCondition that gates when the tint is applied. When absent, the tint is always active. When present, the colour only shows while the condition evaluates true. |

Origins compat: translates `origins:model_color`.

**Example — ghostly blue tint:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:model_color",
  "red": 0.6,
  "green": 0.7,
  "blue": 1.0,
  "alpha": 0.8,
  "name": "Spectral Hue",
  "description": "Your form shimmers with a faint blue glow."
}
```

**Example — red glow at low health:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:model_color",
  "red": 0.9, "green": 0.2, "blue": 0.2, "alpha": 0.7,
  "condition": { "type": "neoorigins:health", "comparison": "<=", "value": 6 },
  "name": "Blood Rage",
  "description": "Your body glows red when near death."
}
```

## `neoorigins:lava_vision`

Increases the player's vision distance while submerged in lava by pushing back the lava fog far plane. Client-side rendering is handled by `VisualEffectsHandler` via `ViewportEvent.RenderFog`.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `strength` | float | no | `3.0` | Fog distance multiplier (higher = further vision in lava). |

Origins compat: translates `origins:lava_vision` (maps the `s` field to `strength`).

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:lava_vision",
  "strength": 5.0,
  "name": "Magma Sight",
  "description": "See clearly through molten rock."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:shader`

Applies a post-processing shader to the player's view via `GameRenderer.loadEffect()`. Origins-style full paths (e.g. `minecraft:shaders/post/desaturate.json`) are automatically normalised to the MC resource location format.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `shader` | resource location | yes | — | Shader id (e.g. `"minecraft:desaturate"`, `"minecraft:spider"`). |

Origins compat: translates `origins:shader`.

**Example — desaturated phantom view:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:shader",
  "shader": "minecraft:desaturate",
  "name": "Phantom Eyes",
  "description": "The world appears washed of colour."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:wraith_phase`

Toggleable spectral phasing. When active the player walks through solid blocks horizontally. While inside a solid block, flight enables (jump = up, shift = down). Holding shift on the surface phases downward into the ground. Certain blocks cannot be phased through.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `blocked_blocks` | list of string | no | `["minecraft:obsidian", "minecraft:crying_obsidian", "minecraft:bedrock"]` | Block IDs that cannot be phased through. |
| `exhaustion_per_tick` | float | no | `0.15` | Hunger drain per tick while inside solid blocks. |
| `always_on` | bool | no | `false` | When `true`, the power is passive (always active, no toggle, no skill key slot). Configurable per tier in the mod config. |

Emits the `wall_phase` capability while active (toggled on or always_on).

**Example — base wraith phase:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:wraith_phase",
  "blocked_blocks": ["minecraft:obsidian", "minecraft:crying_obsidian", "minecraft:bedrock"],
  "exhaustion_per_tick": 0.15
}
```

**Example — apex tier (only bedrock blocks, minimal drain):**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:wraith_phase",
  "blocked_blocks": ["minecraft:bedrock"],
  "exhaustion_per_tick": 0.075
}
```

| `regen_condition` | EntityCondition | no | always-true | Condition for when regeneration occurs |
| `min_action` | EntityAction | no | noop | Action triggered each tick while resource is at minimum |
| `max_action` | EntityAction | no | noop | Action triggered each tick while resource is at maximum |
| `hud_render` | object | no | — | HUD display settings (see below) |
| `hidden` | bool | no | `false` | Whether to hide the bar from the HUD |

**`hud_render` object:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | string | no | `"Resource"` | Display label on the HUD bar |
| `color` | string | no | `"#55AAFF"` | Bar color in `#RRGGBB` or `#AARRGGBB` hex format |

```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:resource",
  "min": 0,
  "max": 100,
  "start_value": 100,

## `neoorigins:slime_moisture`

Custom resource bar (0.0–1.0 float) that drains passively over time, faster in dry biomes (desert, badlands, savanna) and much faster when on fire. Replenished by standing in water or rain. Triggers threshold effects: Regeneration above 75%, armor penalty below 10%, and damage-over-time at 0%.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `drain_per_tick` | float | no | `0.0004` | Base moisture drain per tick |
| `dry_biome_drain_multiplier` | float | no | `3.0` | Drain multiplier in desert/badlands/savanna biomes |

  "name": "Moisture",
  "description": "Must stay hydrated. Dries out faster in hot biomes."
}
```

---

## `neoorigins:slime_death_save`

Death prevention mechanic for slime-themed origins. When the player would die with moisture above the threshold, they "split" instead: teleported to a random location, max HP reduced to 2 hearts, which gradually recovers over time.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `moisture_threshold` | float | no | `0.75` | Moisture level required to trigger the save |
| `teleport_distance` | int | no | `50` | Horizontal blocks to teleport |
| `teleport_y_range` | int | no | `10` | Random Y offset range (±) |
| `split_max_hp` | float | no | `4.0` | Max HP while "split" (2 hearts) |
| `recovery_ticks` | int | no | `2400` | Ticks for HP to recover to normal (default: 120 seconds) |

**Example:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:slime_death_save",
  "name": "Slime Split",
  "description": "Instead of dying, splits and teleports away — but at 2 hearts."
}
```

> Requires a companion `slime_moisture` power to provide the moisture value. Without it, the death save never triggers (moisture defaults to 1.0 and never changes).

---

## `neoorigins:slime_level_hp`

Grants bonus max HP based on the player's experience level. The bonus resets on death (since vanilla drops XP on death).

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `levels_per_hp` | int | no | `10` | Experience levels needed per +1 max HP |
| `max_bonus_hp` | int | no | `20` | Maximum HP bonus cap |

**Example — +1 HP every 10 levels, capped at +20:**
```json
{
  "type": "neoorigins:slime_level_hp",
  "levels_per_hp": 10,
  "max_bonus_hp": 20,
  "name": "Growth",
  "description": "Grows tougher with experience. Resets on death."
}
```

## Composing power sets

Individual 2.0 power types are intentionally narrow so they can be combined. For a "rat"-style origin that marks small mobs it kills and gets a heal buff when attacking anything on the list:

- `neoorigins:entity_set` — declares the UUID set (e.g. `mypack:kill_list`)
- `neoorigins:action_on_event` with `event: kill`, `entity_action: { type: neoorigins:add_to_set, set: mypack:kill_list }` — appends victims to the set
- `neoorigins:condition_passive` with `condition: { type: origins:target_in_set, set: mypack:kill_list }` and `entity_action: { type: neoorigins:heal, amount: 0.5 }` — heals when attacking a marked target

Each piece is a separate power entry in the origin's `powers` array. The `entity_set` power carries no behaviour on its own — it's the shared name other powers read and write.
